      secondDescription: `Nibblin' on sponge cake
      Watchin' the sun bake 
      All of those tourists covered with oil
      Strummin' my six-string
      On my front porch swing
      Smell those shrimp they're beginnin' to boil
      
      Chorus:
      Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
      Searching for my lost shaker of salt
      Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
      But I know it's nobody's fault
      
      I don't know the reason
      I stayed here all season
      Nothin' to show but this brand new tattoo
      But it's a real beauty
      A Mexican cutie
      How it got here I haven't a clue
      
      Chorus:
      Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
      Searchin' for my lost shaker of salt
      Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
      Now I think
      Hell, it could be my fault
      
      I blew out my flip-flop
      Stepped on a pop-top
      Cut my heel had to cruise on back home
      But there's booze in the blender
      And soon it will render
      That frozen concoction that helps me hang on
      
      Wastin' away again in Margaritaville
      Searching for my lost shaker of salt
      Some people claim that there's a woman to blame
      But I know it's my own damn fault
      Yes and some people claim that there's a woman to blame
      And I know it's my own damn fault`,
